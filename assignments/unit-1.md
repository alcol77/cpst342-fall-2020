# Unit 1 Assignment

## Overview
For this assignment, you'll be creating a responsive, two-page website. You are encouraged to use Bootstrap 4 but if you have another framework you like, such as Google's Material UI, or if you prefer to write all the media queries yourself for practice, feel free.

Your website will need to be uploaded to Pantheon and deployed to the `test` environment.

## Requirements

1. Your pages both must be responsive such that there is no horizontal scrolling required.
1. You must embed at least 1 wide image per page that scales proportionately on smaller devices.
1. Your pages must be linked to each other via a navigation menu at the top of the site.
1. At least one page must have two columns of text side-by-side. They should stack one on top of each other on small devices.
1. Your page text should be in a container that prevents the text from going wider than 1200px or 100vw, which ever is smaller.
1. The container mentioned above must be centered on the page.
1. Each page must have 1 `<h1>` tag and at least one more `<h2>` page.
1. You must use at least one `<p>` and at least one `<ul>` (or `<ol>`).
1. You must use an external CSS stylesheet and your stylesheet must have at least 30 rules.
1. You must have at least 3 different selectors in your stylesheet. (examples `p {}`, `.sample-class {}`, `#sample-id {}`).
1. You must have at least 1 cascading rule in your stylesheet.
1. Your site must be deployed to your `cpst342-<name>` website on the test environment.
